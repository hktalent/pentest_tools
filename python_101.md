print(a, b)
a, b = b, a
print(a,b)
```

2. convert elements in a list to a single string
```
a = ["python", "is", "awesome"]
print(" ".join(a))
```

3. find frequencies of occurrence of element in a list
```
 a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,3,3,3,1,2,5,2]
 # This will print out the most frequent element
 print(max(set(a)), key=a.count)
 
 from collections import Counter
 cnt = Counter(a)
 # This parameter stands for the most N frequent elements the most 3 frequent
 print(cnt.most_common(3))
 >>[(3, 5), (2, 4), (1, 3)]
```
4. check if two strings are composed of the same letters
```
Counter('Litter') == Counter('rettiL')
```
