> the Introduction of `grep` `cut` `awk` `sed`

1. the pipeline `|` pass the result from one tool to another tool for example `cat EmailAddresses.txt | sort -u` => **remove the duplicates and sort alphabetically**

2. `xargs` some tools couldn't support `|`. It converts the data stream into space-separated arguments for the specified command. e.g. `find . -name \*.txt | xargs cat`
3. `grep` searches input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list e.g. `grep [options] pattern <file>` 
  * `grep -i` => case insensitive
  * `grep -v` => invert-match
  * `grep -E` => extended regex
  * `grep -f` => Matches all patterns within a file
  * `grep -b` => print the number of lines before the match and matching line
  * `grep -a` => print the number of lines after the match and matching line
4. `cut` `cut -f<fields> [-d’<delimeter>’] [/path/to/input/file]` `-f` specifies a field or fields that returns e.g. `-f 1,3-4`. **fields are delimited by a TAB by default.**`-d` with no space between -d and **only one** character can serve as field separators.
5. `awk` is a programming language for pattern scanning and processing. awk is a tool to run AWK scripts in Bash. e.g. `ps aux | awk '/evilscript/'` `ps aux | awk '/evilscript/ {print $2}' | xargs kill` **awk treats sequential spaces as a single delimitation whereas cut will treat each space as a delimitation** 
6. `sed` is stream editor tool, useful for taking input, applying restructing rules on said input and outputting the results. the most common use for sed is substitution. e.g.`echo hack the world | sed 's/world/planet/'` **wrapping command in single quotes is the best practice to save a lot of escaping headache**

`grep 192. Client-IPs.txt | cut -d: -f2 | sed 's/ //' `
`awk -F'192.' '/192./{print "192."$2}' client-ips.txt | sort -u`
`grep "Status: Up" nmap-scan.gnmap | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u > livehosts.txt`
`awk '/Status\: Up/{print $2}' nmap-scan.gnmap | sort -u > live-hosts.txt`
